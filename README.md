# Animated Menu

This project was built using [ReactJs](https://www.reactjs.org), a Javascript Library
for building web apps faster.

### Why Animated Menu?
To improve user experience, there is a need for a side menu that is collapsible. This will improve the overall app experience as it will give the user the liberty to navigate to and fro the application seamlessly.
When the Menu is an Animated Menu, it makes the whole experience smooth and fun.
